# Analyducks

Over the past several years, I have started to collect rubber ducks. After finding, with much disappointment, that there is no repository or database with duck statistics, I have decided to to make my own! Join me as I collect and explore data on my current flock of ducks. Hoping to turn this into a broader rubber duck website as well for all to enjoy!

## Future expansion ideas
- Profiles for each duck
- Famous rubber ducks
- Places to buy rubber ducks
- Fun facts about rubber ducks (how many does it take to get to the moon???)
